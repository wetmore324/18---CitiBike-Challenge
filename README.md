With the CitiBike data provide for 2023 in New Jersey the following phenomenons were discovered.
  * There were nearly 1 million trips in 2023.
  * Non-members accounted for 1/3 of the total riders.
  * The most frequently used start and end stations for 2023 were Grove St Path and Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl
  * It was also discovered that classic bike were used significantly more than electric bikes for all months of 2023.
  * April and May electric bikes were used the most out of all of the other months.  This surprised me for the winter months.  I thought more would use electric bikes in the colder months to allow them to arrive at their destination quicker.
  * The most frequently used start station for Saturday is Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl while the second most frequently used station for Sunday is South Waterfront Walkway - Sinatra Dr & 1st
  * City Hall is by far the most frequently used end station for all weekdays included in the data.

There are 2 city maps provided, one for the start locations and the other for the end locations.  Each of these maps are labeled by zip code, have markers to represent the frequency of use and detail information provided as you hover over the destination.  Also the map includes a marker box with each month of the year to view the map during different months if needed.
